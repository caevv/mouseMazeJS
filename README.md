# Mouse Maze JavaScript

You have a Lion, make it follow your mouse and be carefull with the walls. Use Vanilla JavaScript.

## How it was accomplished
I created a Canvas copy of the labyrinth' image. After you pass your mouse on the lion, it will resize and then follow your mouse, it does that by changing the top and left to absolute on CSS.



Don't run direct on file:/// as it generate an Sucurity Error. Run on localhost at least.
